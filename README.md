### Grow as you go: Gardening for beginners

#### Description of the project:

Over the course of the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in limited social interaction and extended periods of time at home. During this time, I looked to many activities to fill my time, and found that gardening and learning about growing and nurturing plants became one of my favourite things to do. I find it very calming, meaningful and joyful to see my plants grow, figure out what they need, and learn about how best to care for them. Walking around my apartment complex over the past few months, I noticed that many windows and balconies which were previously empty also started to fill up with plants of all kinds, indicating that gardening is an activity many people in my area have become interested in.

Given my personal interest and growing interest in my local community, I would like this project to be an all-in-one platform that provides beginners a clear starting point and guidance for their gardening journey, as well as the ability to connect with other gardeners in their community to learn from and share experiences with.

#### Severity Rating
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on
project <p>
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority <p>
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority <p>

This app can be likened to having a social media platform dedicated specifically to
gardening, with the additional feature of creating to-do lists for garden
maintenance. The app allows users to post pictures of their gardens, as well as
find and follow other gardeners based on filters such as experience level, space
available for gardening, and location. These functionalities of the app make it a
good model for the kind of platform I would like to create, so I will be using it as a
reference.

**Overall Evaluation:** In general, the app is easy to navigate and use, with and seems
to be primarily targeted towards people seeking a virtual community for
gardening. It has some issues with respect to intuitive design, as well as with
flexibility and efficiency of certain features. Overall though, it fulfils its role as a
platform for gardening enthusiasts to share photos and connect with one another
quite well.
