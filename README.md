### Grow as you go: Gardening for beginners

#### Description of the project:

Over the course of the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in limited social interaction and extended periods of time at home. During this time, I looked to many activities to fill my time, and found that gardening and learning about growing and nurturing plants became one of my favourite things to do. I find it very calming, meaningful and joyful to see my plants grow, figure out what they need, and learn about how best to care for them. Walking around my apartment complex over the past few months, I noticed that many windows and balconies which were previously empty also started to fill up with plants of all kinds, indicating that gardening is an activity many people in my area have become interested in.

Given my personal interest and growing interest in my local community, I would like this project to be an all-in-one platform that provides beginners a clear starting point and guidance for their gardening journey, as well as the ability to connect with other gardeners in their community to learn from and share experiences with.
