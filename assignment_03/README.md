## Specify the main design challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
 - This project aims to provide personalised guidance to users who are getting started withing gardening, by giving advice on plants to grow, how to care for them, and the ability to track plant growth progress and plant-care tasks. By doing so, I hope that users will be encouraged to take up gardening, and stick with it in the long run.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
- This activity can fulfil the user's psychological needs - gardening provides individuals a sense of companionship and comfort, especially in relatively lonely or difficult times such as having limited social interaction due to the ongoing pandemic. Gardening can also provide a sense of accomplishment, as watching one's plants grow and thrive can be really fulfilling and joyful. By providing a clear starting point as well as guidance and next steps, users who are just beginning their gardening journey will have security of knowing they aren't stepping into the activity blindly. They can have the assurance that they will be carefully and kindly guided through the process, so that they are more likely to persist with their gardening journey.

#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
- Current solutions to getting started with gardening usually rely on searching online, or using the few apps available for tracking plant growth and care. The internet does have a plethora of websites and resources for beginners, but the sheer amount of information can be overwhelming, and makes it difficult to know which sources to trust and which not to. 

#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
- Digital technology can enable personalised guidance for users getting started with gardening. Instead of having users sift through the vast amount of information available online, and conclude for themsleves which plants to grow, how many times to water them, which fertiliser to buy, etc., digitial technology can be used to design apps and functionalities that can provide relevant, reliable suggestions on these issues based on some basic background data provided by the user, such as which climate they are in, how much space they have to grow plants, etc.

## Identify target users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
- Demographics - Anyone who has a mobile device and is interested in gardening, but primarily teenagers and individuals in their 20s, 30s. 
- Preferences - Users who want to get started with gardening, have a desire for a handy digital platform to get relevant advice, learn about plant care, and track plant growth
- Expertise - Users don't need any gardening expertise, some familiarity using a mobile device and apps with multiple functionalities would be helpful

#### Where would the users do that activity?
> Users can garden in many settings. In urban environments, where people may not have much outdoor space, they may opt for hydroponics or other forms of vertical gardening, or they may grow a few plants in pots on their balcony, or even indoors. Those who have more outdoor space, such as a frontyards or backyards, have the option to garden in the more traditional sense i.e. outside, on a patch of land.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
- For those who are getting started with gardening, they would likely first look for which plants would be easy/suitable for them to grow, proceed to purchase seeds or seedlings for those plants, or get plant cuttings from a friend. They might purchase plants from a local nursery, or online. They would also likely purchase any necessary implements such as plant pots, watering cans, fertilisers, etc. if they didn't have these. Following this they would need to look up how to care for the plants, and then proceed to do so in order to grow the plants successfully.

### Pick research method
The research method I have chosen is participatory observation, which involved observing the user perform a task, with the user thinking out loud as they did, and me asking questions regarding their choices and actions when necessary. 

Specifically, I wanted to learn how the user would go about gathering information if they wanted to start gardening themselves, and what kinds of information they would be looking for. In order to do so, I asked the user what they would do if they were a beginner at gardening and wanted to get started, and observed what they did, paying particular attention to how they gathered information on this topic (such as which website/app/other platforms or media they used), and what specific information they looked for. As I observed the user make certain choices regarding what they searched for, I asked them questions to understand their reasoning and thought process. I also asked some follow-up questions to understand the user's satisfaction with their search, about what next steps the user would take, and finally some questions about what frustrations they faced during the task and what difficulties they perceived affected people who want to get into gardening.

### Reflection
Overall, the interview went well. For the most part, I was able to stick to the plan in my interview script, beginning with the introduction, background questions, proceeding to the participatory observation and wrapping up with some follow-up questions about their satisfaction level and frustrations. There was good rapport between me and the user, the user was able to understand what was going on and felt comfortable enough to ask questions when they were in doubt. Some things that went differently from my expectation was that the user often went on tangents about things not directly related to the search, but this was nonetheless useful data as it gave me an idea of the user's thinking patterns, and how users can be easily distracted or drawn away from their main search goal. It was a bit tough to resist the urge to ask the user to focus, or guide them back to their search, but refraining from doing so as much as possible ensured that the task was performed authentically by the user, as they would on their own. We did face some mild technical difficulties, which I would ensure don't happen next time. 

Apart from this, other insights I got from this interview has to do with some of the specific concerns and questions the user mentioned when looking for gardening information - they specifically mentioned lack of reliable information relating to growing plants in their climate, and the lack of direct, clear instructions for growing plants. For example, in response to a set of growing instructions that said, "Grow the plants in well-drained soil", the user showed confusion, and went on to say that for beginners such as themselves, it is unclear what exactly "well-drained soil" looks or feels like. Thus they indicated that current available resources were not sufficiently clear or helpful for those just starting out with gardening. Another insight had to do with what kind of plants the user looked for - the user mentioned multiple times that they were looking for plants that would "look good" or "aesthetic", as their main criteria for which plants to cultivate. This was not what I expected, as I thought that as a beginner, the user would be more drawn to plants that are easy to grow. This showed me that even for someone in my target demographic, even if they were just starting out, looks and aesthetics played a key role in what plants they chose to grow. In terms of suggestions, the user made some very good ones, suggesting that an ideal gardening platform would include a forum to communicate with other gardeners, and would allow users to search for plant information by climate and country they lived in. 

Overall, I got a lot of insight and value from this session, understanding the user's concerns, their search patterns, and thought process when looking for gardening information, which has in turn given me a lot of useful data to take into account while working on my project.
