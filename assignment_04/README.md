## The purpose of UX Storytelling

- UC storytelling is a means by which to understand how users interact with a product, and see things from the user's perspective.  This process involves creating personas of potential users of  the product in order to understand and develop emapthy for users' goals and challenges, their expectations of the product, what purpose they want it to fulfil in their lives, all of which will allow us to introduce or improve upon features to enhance their user experience accordingly. 

## Features

- Personalised gardening recommendations: Ask user for relevant data to provide accurate and personalised guidance - what country and climate they live in, how much space they have to grow plants, how much time they have to dedicate to caring for plants, what their budget is â€” based on this data, the app will provide recommendations for which plants to grow, as well as associated care instructions.
- Reminder/notification feature: The user can enable notifications on the app such that they receive regular reminders - such to water their plants, change the soil, add fertilsers, repot the plant, etc. - that are specific to the plant they are growing,  so that they can stay on track with caring for their plants
