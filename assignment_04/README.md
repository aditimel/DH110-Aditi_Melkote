## The purpose of UX Storytelling

- UC storytelling is a means by which to understand how users interact with a product, and see things from the user's perspective.  This process involves creating personas of potential users of  the product in order to understand and develop emapthy for users' goals and challenges, their expectations of the product, what purpose they want it to fulfil in their lives, all of which will allow us to introduce or improve upon features to enhance their user experience accordingly. 

## Features

- Personalised gardening recommendations: Ask user for relevant data to provide accurate and personalised guidance - what country and climate they live in, how much space they have to grow plants, how much time they have to dedicate to caring for plants, what their budget is â€” based on this data, the app will provide recommendations for which plants to grow, as well as associated care instructions.
- Reminder/notification feature: The user can enable notifications on the app such that they receive regular reminders - such to water their plants, change the soil, add fertilsers, repot the plant, etc. - that are specific to the plant they are growing,  so that they can stay on track with caring for their plants

 ### Ciaran's Scenario and Journey Map
 
 #### Why Ciaran is using this product
 
Ciaran is a professional photographer, but ever since the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a months-long lockdown, he has essentially been out of work. Living alone in a lockdown, without much work or purpose, Ciaran has become extremely lonely, and find it difficult to motivate himself get on with his daily tasks. Worried he was becoming depressed, he decides to see a therapist to improve his mental health. The therapist speaks with Ciaran about what brings him joy, and after a few sessions and some deep-thinking, Ciaran has rediscovered his interest in nature, sustainability, and being environmentally conscious. To channel this interest, the therapist suggested that Ciaran grow his own plants, explaining that caring for plants may also help him feel less lonely. This has motivated Ciaran to look into gardening, specifically growing his own fruits and vegetables. He wants to be able to do so within the limited space in his small studio apartment. He also has a limited budget due to his circumstances, and so doesn't want to break the bank in pursuit of this new hobby. Finally, he wants to be able to grow plants suited to the cold weather in Dublin. Ciaran is concerned about finding plants to grow that match his very specific requirements.
 
 #### How Ciaran is using this product
 
After his illuminating virtual therapy session, Ciaran decides to look for more information. He opens up the app, and is prompted to create a profile. After succesfully creating a user profile, he is then prompted to answer a number of questions about his gardening preferences, such as, "What climate do you live in?", "How much space do you have to grow plants", "How much time can you dedicate to plant care?", "What is your budget?", and so forth. Having answered all these questions, he is met with a brief loading screen, after which the app displays a screen with the title "Ciaran's Personalised Plant Recommendations", under which are tabs with the names of plants, including fruits and vegetables, that match Ciaran's preferences - tapping on any of the plant name tabs leads to another page with more information and beginner-friendly next steps. he finds the suggestion to grow lettuce through hydroponics especially intriguing and in line with his criteria, and taps on it to learn more. Ciaran is extremely excited - he can now begin his gardening journey!

### Madeleine's Scenario and Journey Map

#### Why Madeleine is using this product

Madeleine is a very busy third-year univeristy student - between her many classes and intensive coursework, student clubs and organisations, and time spent helping out and catching up with friends and family, she has no time to relax. One day, while helping a friend move into an apartment, her friend asks Madeleine to help decorate the apartment. While decorating the apartment, Madeleine realises the importance of having a calm and comfortable space to come home to every day, and this gets her thinking about decorating her own dorm room. As a nature lover, Madeleine decides that the most obvious way to spruce up her room is to grow her own plants, and thus create a lovely green, garden-like aesthetic she can relax in after a long day. This motivates her to look into what plants she can grow. However, Madeleine can be very forgetful, which, combined with a busy schedule, made her worried that she would not remember or be able to dedicate time to caring for her plants.

#### How Madeleine is using this product

Coming home after classes, Madeleien opens the app on her phone. After creating a profile and receiving personalised recommendations of plants to grow, she selects her plants of choice. Conveniently, the app provides a prompt that asks her if she wants to set up reminders to water her plants, repot them, add fertiliser, and a few other options relating to plant care. Madeleine turns on reminders to water her plants everyday, and to add fertiliser every month, and is happy she has a system in place to care for her plants and create a lush, peaceful, garden-like atmosphere so she can relax in her room.
