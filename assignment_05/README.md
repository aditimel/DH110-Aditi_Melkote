## Overview
**Project description:** This project is centred around providing clear and comprehsive guidance to individuals interested in starting gardening. The app is specifically targeted at beginners and those with minimal experience, and aims to guide users through the gardening process based on their individual situations, so that their interest in sustained and they stick with gardening in the long run.

**Purpose of low-fidelity prototype:** The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to test whether the features I've come up with are easy to use, functional, and relevant to target users.

**User personas:** My personas primarily encompass individuals who are beginners to gardening or have a little prior experience, are teenagers or individuals in their 20s or 30s, are have some experience with using apps and technology such that they would prefer to learn about track plant care on an app, have specific individual requirements when it comes to growing plants, and want a solution that provides clear and personalised plant-care guidance.

**Features and Tasks:** Based on my prior heuristic evaluation and usability testing of a similar gardening app (GardenTags) as well as interview and contextual inquiry of a user in my target demographic, the features which I wish test using this low-fidelity protype are - (a)receive personalised recommendations on which plants to grow; (b) Access plant care information (how many times to water plants, what fertiliser to add, how much sunlight they need, troubleshooting and faqs) for chosen plants; and (c) set up plant care tasks for chosen plants

## Wireframes and Wireflows

The user testing wireflows (with user's pathways marked in green highlight) can be accessed through this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eeXLW93s4mQ4PcrEBJ-z9_0TFCPimkep/view?usp=sharing).

### Wireflow Test Observations:

**Task (a): Receive personalised recommendations on which plants to grow**

> While the user performed this task, I noticed that in the first step, they skipped over enabling location access - they did not "tap" (i.e. highlight in this case) the button that said 'Tap here to enable access to your location', which was puzzling to me as it was the main interaction on that screen. This indicated that the user's general behaviour regarding providing location access, and suggests that the user perhaps does not prefer to provide location data to the app. Another thing I noticed is that the user did not read all of the text on the wireframes, particularly the text in the options for the indoors-outdoors and level of maintenance questions. This suggests to me that the user prefers minimal text, which indicates that user attention span is typically limited and so it is preferable to provide information in a quick, bite-sized form.

**Task (b): Access plant care information (how many times to water plants, what fertiliser to add, how much sunlight they need, troubleshooting and faqs)**

> I observed that the user faced some confusion when faced with the video of soil type" aspects, which made me realise that I should have included another step in the wireflow where tapping on  the video allowed it to expanded so it could be played within the screen

**Task (c): Add plant care tasks for chosen plant**

> In this task the user faced some confusion as the "Back" button on the second wireframe of the wireflow did not match the "Back to My Plants" button on the third wireframe. This caused the user to believe the second and third wireframes were two different pages, when actually the third wireframe was the same as the second, just that another task had been added. This confusion also caused the user to question why they could not go back from the third wireframe to the second wireframe. This mistake in naming the buttons was an error on my part.

## Reflection
Overall, I think the process of low-fidelity protyping went well. I found it to be quite enjoyable actually, to come up with potential interfaces and flows for the app, bringng together many of the ideas and observations from the previous weeks of working on the project. While conducting the wireflow tests, the user was able to understand the general purpose of each feature, and able to perform the tasks with a large degree of accuracy, although there were a few confusions along the way for each task, as discussed previously. The aspects of the process that went smoothly were that the user was therefore that the user was able to understand the general goal and purpose of each feature quickly and easily, and I did not have to spend too much time explaining the task to them. They were comfortable enough to express their doubts and thoughts while going through the wireflow, which helped me understand where the confusion was arising, and what aspects of the features and the wireflow could perhaps be improved. 

Based on the shortcomings I described under "Wireflow Test Observations", the improvements I would make to my low-fidelity prototyping, per task, are as follows:

*Task (a):* Observing the way the user just skipped over providing location data suggested to me that they might not be comfortable providing this data. Thus, taking into account the heuristics that dictate user freedom, and flexibility for the user, I would make the improvement of giving users an alternative way to answer the climate question, such as to select from a drop down list of climates, such as "Hot, humid, tropical", "temperate", "desert", and so forth. Alternatively, I could provide users a filter bar, where they can type in what they feel are relevant terms such as "tropical", and select those terms from the filters that appear. I would also provide the caveat that their recommendations may be slightly less accurate due self-reporting of climates, as opposed to providing access to location data. 

*Task (b):* Observing user's slight confusion regarding the video functionality, in future testing I would add a further wireframe such that users can see that tapping on the video would allow it to be played within the screen. I would also include a similar wireframe for the image, such that tapping on the image would enlarge it so it can be seen more clearly. 

*Task (c):* Observing the user's confusion regarding the mismatched "Back" button (second wireframe) and "Back to My Plants" button (third wireframe) in the wireflow, I would correct this to ensure that both buttons say "Back to My Plants".

Overall, I have learned a lot from performing this low-fidelity prototyping. Conducting the wireflow tests showed me that the features I came up with are fundamentally useful and easy to understand, which aligns with my goasl for this project to make gardening more clear and accessible to beginners. However it has also shown me some of the mistakes in specific details or interactions I have made while designing the features, which I can now go ahead and improve on, and further enhance the user experience.
