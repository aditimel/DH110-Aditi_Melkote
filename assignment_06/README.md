# Assignment 6 - User Interface Design: High Fidelity Prototype (Part 1)
### Aditi Melkote, DH110

## Overview

**Project description:** The aim of this project is to create a platform that will provide guidance to individuals interested in starting gardening. It aims to do so by providing beginners personalised recommnedations for plant growth and care, as well as access to clear, understandable instructions and advice. Through this app, I hope to help beginners not only cultivate their plants, but cultivate their interest in gardening and plant care as well.

**Purpose of high-fidelity prototype:** The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to visualise the various interfaces and functionalities within this app. By visualising the interfaces in a format users are familiar with, I hope to gain an understanding of how they will interact with the app, what features and functionalities they find useful or not, and make any improvements accordingly to enhance the overall user experience of the app.

**Process:** This high-fidelity prototype has been the culmination of research and information gained from previous steps including usabability testing, contextual inquiry and interview, persona creation, as well as low-fidelity prototyping. These previous steps have allowed me to gather valuable data regarding target users' thoughts, needs, and concerns about starting gardening, features they liked/disliked in other gardening apps and websites, features they would like to see in an app such as the one being prototyped here, as well as their natural interactions with the flow of interfaces in the low-fidelity protoype. Based on observations and feedback from the previous steps, I have made some improvements to my interfaces and features from the low-fidelity prototype to create the following high-fidelity prototype using Figma, incorporating necessary features of user interafce design. The high-fiedlity prototyping will also involve conducting an accessibility check to ensure it is WCAG2.0 AA compliant, as well as an impression test to understand users' initial impressions and perceptions of the prototype interfaces.

**Tasks:** (a) Receive personalised recommendations on which plants to grow; (b) Access plant care information (how many times to water plants, what fertiliser to add, how much sunlight they need, troubleshooting and faqs) for chosen plants; and (c) Set up plant care tasks for chosen plants
