# Sprout
## Aditi Melkote

### Introduction
Over the course of the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in limited social interaction and extended periods of time at home. During this time, I looked to many activities to fill my time, and found that gardening became one of my favourite things to do. Over time, caring for my plants and seeing them grow has become a calming, meaningful and joyful activity for me. Going through social media and speaking to my friends and extended family, I found that lots of them had also developed an interest in gardening as a way of spending time during their lockdowns. 

However, as a complete beginner to gardening, I faced challenges in terms of finding reliable, comprehensive, beginner-friendly plant care information online. This was a concern echoed by some of my friends who also wished to start growing plants, but found the initial step into gardening overwhelming and slightly daunting. These experiences sparked the idea for my project - a plant-care app called “Sprout”, that is focussed on providing a clear, reliable, and easy-to-understand starting point and guidance in gardening for beginners. By providing a clear starting point as well as guidance and next steps, users who are just beginning their gardening journey can have the assurance that they will be carefully and kindly guided through the process, allowing it to be more fun and enjoyable for them.
With Sprout, I hope to provide a comprehensive plant-care platform that will be a the first-stop for beginners to gardening.

### Clear design statement 

The issue here is that getting started with gardening as a beginner can be challenging, considering the vast amount of plant care information available online. As a complete beginner, it is difficult to ascertain which sources of information are accurate and reliable. Further, the available information is not always tailored to those with little to no prior knowledge about gardening, making the learning curve steep. This tedious process of scouring multiple websites, trying to consolidate the variety information available online and figure out which plant to grow, and how to care for it, can be tiring and discouraging to beginners. 
The question therefore, is how can the experience of getting started with gardening be improved, such that it is easier, more approachable and ultimately more enjoyable to beginners? 

**The Sprout app aims to enhance the experience of gardening beginners by guiding them through the initial steps, providing reliable, beginner-friendly plant care information within the app itself, and helping users develop the habit of caring for their plants so that they can easily begin and truly enjoy their gardening journey.** 

### Competitor analysis
#### Heuristic Evaluation
The first step in my project was conducting a heuristic evaluation of platforms that were on the same subject as my project. Thus I conducted a heuristics evaluation, based on Nielson’s 10 design heuristics, of the the GardenTags app, and the National Parks (Singapore) website. The purpose of this heuristics evaluation was to understand the features and effectiveness of available gardening resources, how suitable they might be for beginners, and how they could be improved. I found that the GardenTags app functioned more like a social media platform, allowing users to create a profile and add their plants to it, post pictures of their plants, and seek out advice from other users through commenting and messaging features. In terms of Nielson's heuristics, it had some issues with respect to intuitive design (#heuristic 2), as well as with flexibility and efficiency (heuristic #7) of features relating to plant search information and general flow of the app. The National Parks website meanwhile served more like a repository for useful gardening-related links, providing access to various documents and PDFs of plant recommendations and plant care tips. The main issues on this site in terms of Nielson's heuristics had to do with a slight lack of consistency between pages (heuristic #4) [...read more](https://github.com/aditimel/DH110-Aditi_Melkote/blob/main/README.md)

#### Usability Testing
Performing a usability test as part of the UX design process allows for an analysis of how to easy to use an app/website/platform is for the user, and in turn identify any significant design problems or barriers to a good user experience. Ultimately, the goal of usability testing is to be able to improve interaction with the app from a user's point of view. For my pilot usability test, I tested the GardenTags app for tasks that related to whether the user could access plant care and purchase information on the app.[...read more](https://github.com/aditimel/DH110-Aditi_Melkote/tree/main/assignment-02)
